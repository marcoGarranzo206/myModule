# myModule
A collection of scripts written over the years. As of now will probably not be understood by anyone else.<br>
Will try to organize it into more modules and probably delete it afterwards.<br>

**functions**: python functions I use quite often and decided to dump here.<br>
**objects**: python objects I use quite often and decided to dump here. Includes a bidirectional dictionary and a genetic algorithm solver.<br>
**bktreeAhupp**: bk tree code from https://github.com/ahupp/bktree/ for efficient spell checking of a large dictionary.<br>
**evaluate_DDI**: code to evaluate a DDI 2013 challenge. As of now only evaluates NER detection.<br>
**extraPrograms**: to tokenize and lemmatize scientific texts using chemTok and bioLemmatizer, written in java, when using python. <br>
**graphs**: some functions to work with netwrokx graphs.<br>
**myStats**: FDR and a function to do binomial testing.<br>
**ontology**: objects to work with ontologies downlaoded in csv files from NCBIO portal. Includes the ability to scan texts for terms in the ontology and to normalize entities via their synonyms.<br>
**NER**: module for NER. Includes scripts for loading DDI extraction data, a bidirectional cnn crf for NER and a flexible module for processing raw text. Also includes a embedder using BERT models.<br>
**RE**: modulefor relationship extraction. Extract relationships between entities using lstm trees. Text must be parsed using a syntax tree according to XXX.<br>
